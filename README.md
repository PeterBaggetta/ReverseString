# Reverse String Program

**Reverse String Program** is a simple C# console application where the user enters a word, and the program returns it in reverse.  
It also checks whether the entered word is a **palindrome**.  

## Features
- **String reversal**: Takes user input and outputs it in reverse.  
- **Palindrome detection**: Identifies if the word reads the same forwards and backwards.  

## How It Works
1. The program welcomes the user with an introduction message.  
2. The user is prompted to enter a word.  
3. The program:  
   - Iterates through the string in reverse order.  
   - Stores the reversed characters in a new array.  
   - Converts the array back into a string.  
4. The reversed word is displayed to the user.  
5. If the reversed word matches the original input, the program declares it a **palindrome**.  

## Purpose
This project was developed for educational purposes to practice:  
- Basic string manipulation in C#  
- Working with character arrays  
- Using loops for iteration  
- Implementing simple logic for palindrome detection  
- Creating interactive command-line applications
